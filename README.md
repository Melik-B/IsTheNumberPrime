<h3>Is The Number Prime :</h3>

Hello sir, the purpose of this <b>SIMPLE</b> console project you have seen is to show whether the number you entered is prime or not. With this simple console project, you can improve yourself on loops, conditions or methods.


```bash
  eg: Enter a positive number (0 for output): 2
  Number entered is prime!
  OR
  eg: Enter a positive number (0 for output): 3
  The number entered is not prime!
```

<b>ALGORITHM</b>

- Start.
- The user is prompted to enter a number.
- Counter = 2.
- If the number is 2 the number is prime, go to step 1.7.
- If number % counter = 0 then the number is not prime to the screen, go to step 1.6.
- Counter = counter + 1 if counter < number go to step 1.5.
- Finish it.
- Start.
- The user is prompted to enter a number.
-   counter value is incremented up to number starting from 2
- If the remainder of the number divided by the counter is 0, the number is not prime.
- number is prime if the remainder is not 0 after dividing the number by any value of the counter.
- The prime state of the number is printed on the screen.
